# Bake the lesson lines that have no studio recording into portable WAVs.
#
# Same approach as build-fallback-audio.ps1 and the same voice, so these sit
# alongside the three question lines already generated this way rather than
# introducing a second synthetic voice. SpeakProgress supplies word times from
# the audio clock, which is what drives the word-by-word reveal on the sign.
#
# Existing studio recordings are never touched. Re-running is safe: each file
# is rewritten from its line, and the JSON is regenerated from scratch.
