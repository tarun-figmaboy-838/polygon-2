   One thing has to be true once one of these questions is answered. When the
   sign says there is a gap in the boundary, the gap itself has to be marked on
   the shape --- the learner cannot be asked to take the sentence on trust. A
   closed boundary is the other half of that contract: nothing is drawn on it,
   because there is nothing to point at, and recolouring an outline the learner
   has just read correctly only obscures the thing the question was about. Both
   are numbers here, so a later change cannot quietly drop or reverse them. */
